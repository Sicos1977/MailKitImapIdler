A demo program that shows how to use IMAP IDLE mode with MailKit

How to use this code...

- 1: Create a connection manager
- 2: Set an output stream for logging... or not
- 3: Add an Imap connection to the ConnectionManager

I tested this code with 40 mailboxes all in NOOP mode without any problems.
